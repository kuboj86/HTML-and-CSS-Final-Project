                <h2>Summary</h2>
                    Cattleya orchids are not difficult to care for, and even beginners can find success with getting them to flower. They make lovely houseplants, but they can also live outside year-round in tropical climates and during the warmer months in areas that experience frost.

                    The key to growing them successfully is providing the right amount of light, maintaining the proper temperature and humidity, and watering and feeding adequately. The orchids typically don’t have any serious problems with pests or disease if their growing conditions are suitable. But watch out for some common houseplant pests that can cause foliage damage, including scale, mealybugs, and spider mites. Plus, keep an eye on the pseudobulbs (the swollen storage organs on the stems), which can give you clues about your plant's health. A plump pseudobulb indicates a happy, well-hydrated plant.

                <h2>Light</h2>
                These orchids need bright indirect light for optimal growth. When grown as a houseplant, an east- or west-facing window that gets a lot of light is ideal. However, any harsh midday sun that comes through the window should be diffused with a sheer curtain. Similarly, the orchids like outdoor sunlight in the morning but should be protected from the strong afternoon sun. Cattleya orchids that aren’t getting enough light will have darker than normal foliage, and they often won’t flower. The foliage of orchids that are getting too much light often will turn yellowish or even be scorched brown or black in some areas. 
                <h2>Water</h2>
                These orchids require a moderate amount of moisture. Water whenever the growing medium is fairly dried out; typically a weekly watering is sufficient. Do not let the orchids sit in a consistently wet growing medium, which can cause root rot. At each watering, water deeply so that the water sprays the foliage and runs through the container drainage holes. Many growers prefer to sit the orchid container in a sink to do this. It’s best to water in the mornings, so the foliage has time to dry in the light. Otherwise, lingering dampness can cause mildew and other disease.

                <h2>Soil</h2>
                Cattleya orchids will thrive in a commercial growing mix made specifically for orchids. This usually includes fir or sequoia bark and potentially perlite, horticultural charcoal, coconut husk chips, tree fern fiber, clay pellets, gravel, and more. When grown outdoors cattleya orchids can be slab-mounted, a technique in which the orchid is manually attached to a tree host. To mount the orchid, wrap the roots in moss; wire the plant on top of a shelf (made of organic materials, such as driftwood or cork bark); and attach it to a branch, tree trunk, or log.

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                The orchid group includes several several hundred different genera and thousands of species, but most people are introduced to orchids through the Phalaenopsis genus, which are particularly good orchids for beginners. These are thick-leaved plants with elegant, arching sprays of bloom—the orchids featured in so many design magazines sitting on coffee tables across America.

                Phalaenopsis orchids are rewarding plants. They are not demanding, and in the right conditions, they will display showy blooms for months.

                <h2>How to Grow Phalaenopsis Orchids</h2>
                Phalaenopsis orchids are hardy in zones 10 to 12, where they can be grown outdoors in warm, humid conditions that are damp but not soggy, in a location that is shady but bright (no direct sun). 
                More often, these plants are grown as indoor potted plants, where successful growth means finding the right balance between humidity, temperature, light, and airflow. 
                Their long-lasting flowers are held on arching branches and open successively. A single multi-branching flower spike can have more than 20 flowers, 
                and individual flowers can last for weeks.
                <h2>Light</h2>
                Good light is required for phalaenopsis but they can experience absolutely no direct sunlight, or the leaves will scorch. Rotate the plant from time to time to keep growth equal. 
                Phalaenopsis can tolerate low light and will thrive in an east window, or a shaded southerly or westerly exposure. Also, 
                they will do well under common grow lights positioned about a foot from the plant. A well-grown plant will have darker green leaves on top and streaks of red or burgundy on the 
                undersides.
                <h2>Water</h2>
                Phalaenopsis is a monopodial orchid, which means that it grows from a single stem. It does not have the large water-storing pseudobulbs found on sympodial orchids, although its leaves can store some water. Thus, this plant has a lower tolerance for drought.

                During the growing season, water the plant weekly or whenever its exposed roots turn silvery white. Water them in the morning and try to keep the potting media slightly damp. 
                During the flowering season, you can cut the water back to every other week. Water should never be allowed to rest around the stem of the plant. 
                This will cause the new leaves to rot, and the plant will die.

                <h2>Soil</h2>
                In native conditions, moth orchids grow on trees as epiphytes—a type of plant that requires a host plans. Instead of regular soil, 
                they need potting material that mimics a host tree or comes from a tree, such as ground fir tree bark, redwood bark chips, or Monterey pine bark chips. 
                Most bark potting media will work. Also, make sure there is some perlite, sphagnum moss, charcoal, or coconut husk chips mixed in to help with water retention. 
                You can also buy a commercial potting mix that is made special for orchids. No matter the potting media you use, make sure there is plenty of air circulation for the 
                rooting system. Epiphytes are accustomed to breezes and wind and don't do well without it.
